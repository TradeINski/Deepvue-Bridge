# Deepvue-Bridge
Format and manage your copied tickers from Deepvue with ease!

Deepvue Bridge is a productivity extension that helps traders and analysts using app.deepvue.com quickly copy and organize stock tickers in a cleaner, more shareable format. Instead of pasting space-separated tickers, this extension automatically converts them into comma-separated lists perfect for importing into brokers or spreadsheets.

⭐️ Features
✅ Auto-format clipboard content
Whenever you copy tickers on Deepvue, they're automatically transformed into a clean, comma-separated list.
✅ Custom copy buttons
Adds dedicated 📋 copy buttons next to ticker elements on Deepvue to make copying cleaner and easier.
✅ Global "Copy All Tickers" button
Copy your entire watchlist or screen results in one click.
✅ Reload & Auto-copy
A single click reloads Deepvue and triggers its own copy widget to grab fresh data automatically.
✅ Persistent history
Your last copied tickers are saved locally and shown in the extension popup.
✅ Optional grouping
Group copied tickers into blocks of 30 for easier pasting into broker limits.
✅ Compact popup interface
View, group, and copy your saved tickers right from the extension icon.

📌 How It Works

✅ When you copy tickers on the site, the extension formats and stores them automatically.
✅ The extension popup shows your latest copied tickers, with options to group or copy them again.
✅ Use the "Reload" button in the popup to refresh Deepvue and auto-trigger its built-in copy widget for updated tickers.
